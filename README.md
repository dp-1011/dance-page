# Hi 👋 I am Devang 
 


## Project Name : **Dance Academy Landing Page !**

The output looks is great for this project a hero photo covering the right side using Z-index and all the content is on the left. The CSS code can be written so much better for the one that I have written. One thing that I have note after this is using of position will create havoc while using media query.
